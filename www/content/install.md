Antibody can be installed through a variety of sources.

The simplest way is to run:

```sh
curl -sL git.io/antibody | sh -s
```

This will put the binary in `/usr/local/bin/antibody`

You can also use homebrew (on macOS):

```sh
brew tap getantibody/tap
brew install getantibody/tap/antibody
```

Or even using [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/antibody/) on Arch Linux.

You can also always download and install manually via tar.gz archives or
using dpkg and our deb archives. Just head to the
[releases page](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody/releases) and chose
your poison.
